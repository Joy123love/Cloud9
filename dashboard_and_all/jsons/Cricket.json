    "question": "How can the performance trends of the Zimbabwean men's cricket team be described?",
    "answer": "The performance trends of the Zimbabwean men's cricket team can be described as declining, stagnant, stagnant and stabilizing, falling in circles, moving in circles, beginning to improve, reaching rock bottom, declining every day with nothing positive, declining at a shocking rate, getting worse, approaching rock bottom, falling and falling on ICC Ranking, indeed suffering as supporters, and even losing to countries like United Arab Emirates."
